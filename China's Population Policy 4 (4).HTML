<p style="border: 2px solid black"><font size="5" font face="Calibri">China introduced the one-child policy on 25th September 1980 under the order of Former Chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Den Xiaoping. The policy was anti-natalist, meaning it promoted population decline, aiming to limit the population to 1.2 billion but preferably 1.1 billion by 2000. It planned to achieve this goal by restricting families to being only able to have 1 child. The policy was implemented because it was concerned that China’s rapid population growth would strain national welfare systems, political institutions, the state planned economy and increase pressure on services. It also aimed to boost economic growth as there would be less citizens that the country would have to provide for.

<p style="border: 2px solid black"><font size="5"> <font face="Calibri">Families who complied with the policy were granted the one child certificate, which entitled them to several benefits. These include higher salaries, interest-free loans, cheaper fertiliser for agriculture, better housing and healthcare, retirement funds, a school enrolment priority for the child and preferential job opportunities. Parents that did not comply would have their salary payments delayed, their careers obstructed, receive fines (from $370 to $12,800) and (sometimes but especially in the early 1980’s) be forced to undergo abortions. If the family was unable to pay the fine: they could lose their job, house, livestock and have their child taken away or denied benefits of the state (such as education). Methods of contraception were also made more widely available and a nation-wide family planning service was initiated.

        <p style="border: 2px solid black"><font face="Calibri"> <font size="5"><b>Socially</b>. The OCP had positive impacts in nutritional intakes for children and human capital (the knowledge, skills and experiences an individual has). The policy also attributed to improvements in healthcare and welfare for children and women. China launched a nation-wide family planning program in the 1970s to support the policy.<br><br><b>Economically</b>. The household saving rate increased from 10.4% in in 1983 to 30.5% in 2011. This could have been caused by families not needing to spend as much due to having a smaller number of children and an increased pressure on parents to save for retirement as they have less children to support them when they are older.<br><br><b>Environmentally</b>. Chinese government officials estimated that the policy prevented 300 million – 400 million births, which would curtail the amount of resources needed to be provided significantly. According to Chinese negotiators, the annual emissions of greenhouse gasses was reduced by as much as 1.8 billion tons as a result of the policy.  </font face="Calibri"> </font size="5"></b></p></font color="blue">

<p style="border: 2px solid black"><font size="5"><font face="Calibri">
    <b>Socially</b>. The policy and its penalties contributed to political dissent among the people and a 34% increase in financial crime rate. The increased crime rate is due to the male-heavy sex ratio with their being 36 million more males than females from 1980 – 2010. This male skewed sex ratio led to financial pressures on men to attract a partner, often causing them to commit financial crimes.<br><br> <b>Economically</b>. the reduced fertility rate and aging population increased the number of old dependents and decreased the number of economically active people. This strained the economy as there was not enough people working to support the population. Children born outside of the policy (referred to as heihaizi) were denied education and thus often could not be able to contribute to the economy effectively. Starting from 1980: every 1% increase in population correspond to a 1.2% decrease of national GPD; a trend which was caused by the OCP.<br><br><b>Environmentally</b>. The policy caused a quarter of the Chinese population to enter the middle-class. This led to an increase in the requirement of resources such as food, water, wood and electricity which impacted the environment negatively. Families also had their livestock confiscated as a penalty of disobeying the population policy, which exacerbated the problem as they could not rely on their own farming for food.

Reforms of the One Child Policy
</font face="Century Gothic"> </font size="10"></p><font color="black">

<p style="border: 2px solid black"><font size="5" font face="Calibri">

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China released Document No. 7 on 13th April 1984. The document states that ethnic minorities (the non-Han population) were allowed to have a second child while rural families could only do so if the first offspring was a daughter. The loosened restrictions on rural families were a result of resistance from rural communities. On 1st January 2016, the 2-child policy was introduced, which allowed all families to have a limit of 2 children. The 3-child policy was announced on 31st May 2021; it increased the limit to 3 children and is still active to this day. In order to promote fertility in Sichuan, the province’s government dropped all childbearing restrictions and its penalties in January 2023.

<p style="border: 2px solid black"><font size="5" font face="Calibri">
The population policy’s main goal was to limit the population to, at most, 1.2 billion by 2000. This worked out as the population of the country during that year was 1.263 billion. However: the population policy had an overall negative effect on the economy as it caused China’s GPD to decrease. Socially: the policy had mixed effects. The negatives impacts were that the rate of financial crimes increased by 34% and that citizens grew dissatisfied with the government due to the penalties imposed. The positive impacts relate to improvements in nutritional intake, welfare and health among children and women. The policy also benefited the environment as it reduced the annual greenhouse gas emissions by 1.8 billion tons.<br><br>
Overall: I believe that the OCP failed because the positive effects of the policy could have been replicated by the country’s spendings in certain areas and its economic development. If China just promoted family planning, made methods of contraception more widely available and developed its economy: its population would have likely decreased. The reduced greenhouse gas emissions could have also been achieved by investments in clean energy while improvements in healthcare, welfare and nutritional intake could also be accomplished through expenditures in public services. The one child policy, however, makes economic development and investments like these more unlikely because the policy weakened the economy. Another major goal for the OCP was to relieve pressure on public services and political institutions, however an exhausted economy would arguably strain these services and institutions.
